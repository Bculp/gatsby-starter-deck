## Todos
- [ ] flesh out outline?

- [ ] add a CRA vs Gatsby section
  - routing
  - intro to react

## Michael's Feedback from dry run
- [ ] Go over Gatsby build process

## Ryan's notes from direct feedback

- [ ] diff between create-react-app

  - starter templates

  - static vs dynamic

- [x] brief intro to react (think we can skip this as long as we don't make assumptions when demoing components)

- [ ] Gatsby Link info (how does it work?)

- [ ] more differentiators between Gatsby and other frameworks

https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/1458

- [ ] More of a note than a todo. Start pres w/ intros & give our story about Gatsby:
  - Show Momentum site
  - Explain why we used it (no specifics, just general overview) (Lift & Shift + Redesign of existing site) -> we'll cover more reasons in the presentation

- 36:56 - first run
